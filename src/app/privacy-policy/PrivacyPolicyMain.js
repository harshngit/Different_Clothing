We may also collect personal information that you post in your profile, requests or feedback, and any comments or discussions you post in any blog, chat room, or other correspondence site on the Platform.

You undertake that your personal information shall at all times be accurate, complete and up to date. We shall also make reasonable efforts to provide you with the opportunity to request correction of your personal information provided to us if the same is inaccurate; or even to delete the personal information, if so requested and subject to applicable law. Further, we may decline to process requests which we find to be contrary to the terms laid down under this Policy, Platform Terms and Conditions or any applicable laws, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others or are extremely impractical.

2. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES

You may at times be permitted to log into our Platform through your other social networking accounts. If you do so, you must enter the email address and password that you use for such social networking accounts. We will ask that you grant us permission to access and collect your basic information (this includes your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, date of birth, email address, and any other information you have set to public on your account). If you allow us to have access to this information, then we will retain this information even if you have chosen later not to make that information public.

We store the information that we receive from such social networking sites with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.

Such social networking sites control the information they collect from you. For information about how social networking sites may use and disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the respective social networking sites’ privacy policy. We have no control over how any third-party site uses or discloses the personal information it collects about you.

3. COLLECTION OF AUTOMATIC INFORMATION, USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING DEVICES

We and our third party service providers, which include ad networks, use Cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our Platform and Services, such as your browser type, your ISP or operating system, your domain name, your access time, the URL of the previous website you visited, your page views, your IP address, and the type of device that you use. We also track how frequently you visit our Platform and use our Services. We use this information (including the information collected by our third party service providers) for Website analytics (including to determine which portions of our Platform are used most frequently, what our users like/do not like), to assist us in determining relevant advertising (both on and off our Platform), to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns, and as otherwise described in this policy. We may obtain your device ID, which is sent to Union Living’s servers and used in fraud prevention efforts.

Cookies.
We and our third-party service providers collect information from you by using Cookies. A Cookie is a small file stored on the user's computer hard drive containing information about the user. The Cookie helps us analyse web traffic or informs you about your use of a particular website. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual, tailoring its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. When you visit the Platform, we may send one or more Cookies (i.e., a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters) to your computer that identifies your browser.

Some of these Cookies may be connected to third-party companies or websites. The terms of use of such Cookies are governed by this Policy and the privacy policy of the relevant third-party company or website. For example, Google measures the performance of advertisements by placing Cookies on your computer when you click on ads. If you visit the Platform when you have such Cookies on your computer, we and Google will be able to tell that you saw the ad delivered by Google. The terms of use of these Cookies are governed by this Policy and Google's Privacy Policy.

Disabling Cookies.
You can choose to accept or decline Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept Cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline Cookies if you prefer. If you disable Cookies you may be prevented from taking full advantage of the Platform because it may not function properly if the ability to accept Cookies is disabled.

Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Platform to, among other things, track the activities of Platform visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Platform usage. We and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

You acknowledge that some entities and /or countries where we may transfer your personal information may not comply with data protection policies which are as stringent as the laws of India or the policies followed by Union Living. You acknowledge that it is adequate that when we transfer your personal information to any other entity within or outside India, we will place contractual obligations on the transferee which will oblige the transferee to adhere to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.


<br/><br/>

For customer support and to respond to your inquiries;
For internal record-keeping purposes;
To process billing and payment, including sharing with third party payment gateways in connection with Platform and/or Services;

To resolve disputes, to protect ourselves and other users of our Platform and Services, and to enforce our Platform’s terms and conditions;
We also may compare personal information collected through the Platform and Services to verify its accuracy with personal information collected from third parties; and
We may combine aggregate data with the personal information we collect about you.
We may disclose your personal information or part thereof to third parties. Such information shall include name, email, mobile number, and other information which is capable of identifying you except for any ‘sensitive personal information’ as defined under Information Technology Act, 2000 and Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011. This personal information is shared only to be used for lawful purposes including but not limited to making promotional calls and sending transactional messages and/or email notifications. Union Living does not endorse using personal information by third parties for any illegal purposes.

From time to time, Union Living may use personal information for new and unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. If our information practices change regarding information previously collected, Union Living shall make reasonable efforts to provide notice and obtain consent of any such uses as may be required by law.

It is further clarified that your registration on the Website shall be deemed to be your consent to be contacted for the purposes mentioned above, (i) on the mobile number shared by you even if you are registered with the National Customer Preference Register (NCPR) and have opted out of receiving promotional calls and messages and (ii) by way of SMS or email notifications or messages in any other electronic form.

<br/><br/>
C. ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS, INVITATIONS, POLLS AND SURVEYS
<br/>
At our sole discretion, Union Living may offer any of the following free services on the Platform, which you may select to use or receive at your option. Certain of the following services may require you to provide additional personal information as detailed below:
<br/>
1. ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS
<br/>
We may offer a free electronic newsletter to users. We will gather the email addresses of users who sign up for Union Living for the newsletter mailing list. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by opting out of receiving newsletters during the registration process, by following the link provided in each newsletter that points users to a subscription management page where the user can unsubscribe from receiving newsletters or by changing their preferences in their Profile Settings page.
<br/><br/>
2. "SEND TO A FRIEND"
<br/>
Our Platform users can voluntarily choose to electronically forward a link, page, or document to someone else by clicking "send to a friend." To do so, the user must provide his or her email address, as well as the email address of the recipient. The user's email address is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.
<br/><br/>
3. POLLING
<br/>
We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues, Services, and/or the Platform. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. We may use a system to "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.
<br/><br/>
4. SURVEYS
<br/>
We may conduct user surveys from time to time to better target our content to our Platform users. We will not share individual responses from these surveys with any third party. We will share aggregate data with third party service providers, partners, and other third parties.
<br/><br/>
D. Security
<br/>
We employ procedural and technological security measures, which are reasonably designed to help protect your personal information from unauthorised access or disclosure. Union Living may use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorised access and disclosure. No security measures, however, are 100% complete. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will not be collected and used by others. You should take steps to protect against unauthorised access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.

Union Living is not responsible for the unauthorised use of your information or for any lost, stolen, compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorised password activity.
